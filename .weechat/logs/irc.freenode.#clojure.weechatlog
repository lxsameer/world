2016-04-02 19:00:00	sdegutis	Presenter should be $ since it usually involves formatting, similar to turning 1234.56 into "$1,234.56"
2016-04-02 19:02:34	sdegutis	View should be x# since it's just Hiccup which often involves HTML-based #id tags.
2016-04-02 19:02:59	sdegutis	Hmm, maybe model should be x! since it's just way so exciting?
2016-04-02 19:03:24	sdegutis	Not x= because that implies some sort of equality checking.
2016-04-02 19:04:12	sdegutis	Maybe model could be x+ because it represents the superior form of x, in terms of purity.
