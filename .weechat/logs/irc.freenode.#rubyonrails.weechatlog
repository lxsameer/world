2016-04-02 14:04:51	arup_r	Can you give some hints, how you code when you need to export ~ 147795 records to CSV? standard approach, like opening a CSV, and then putting one record at a time by iterating via .each AR object seems slow to me. So what is the best optimized way?
2016-04-02 14:05:50	workmad3	arup_r: one-off export or something you need to do on a regular basis?
2016-04-02 14:06:16	arup_r	workmad3: yes. I will export each day, and then upload the csv to FTP site
2016-04-02 14:06:39	workmad3	arup_r: I'd look at doing it directly in postgres then
2016-04-02 14:06:52	arup_r	you mean postgres `copy` command?
2016-04-02 14:06:55	workmad3	yup
2016-04-02 14:07:05	arup_r	I am also thinking like that. That is the fastest..
2016-04-02 14:07:14	arup_r	ok. cool
2016-04-02 14:07:30	workmad3	arup_r: if it was a one-off, I'd say screw it and just do it in a loop :)
2016-04-02 14:07:51	arup_r	because the records will be fetched from 4-5 tables joins, still figuring though
2016-04-02 14:08:03	arup_r	nah.. it is a regular task
2016-04-02 14:08:12	arup_r	so `copy` command is fastest..
2016-04-02 14:08:21	workmad3	arup_r: SELECT blah INTO <temp_table>; COPY ...
2016-04-02 14:08:27	workmad3	and then remove your temp table
2016-04-02 14:08:49	arup_r	hm.
2016-04-02 14:08:52	workmad3	or create a view over your query and COPY the view
2016-04-02 14:09:21	arup_r	workmad3: good choice is SQL view.

2016-04-02 14:09:34	arup_r	But i have a question for that though... Let me ask
2016-04-02 14:09:36	workmad3	and yeah, I doubt you'll get faster than the database dumping out your CSV in most circumstances...

2016-04-02 14:10:46	arup_r	so if I create a view, and then run rake db:reset ( locally ), then view is gone. I have to create it again manually.. So what is the best way to get back those views on db recreations..
2016-04-02 14:12:09	arup_r	ok.. got one idea https://rietta.com/blog/2015/03/30/adding-rake-db-views-for-sql-views-to-a-rails-project/
2016-04-02 14:12:43	workmad3	arup_r: scenic gem
2016-04-02 14:13:04	arup_r	https://blog.pivotal.io/labs/labs/rails-and-sql-views-part-2-migrations or this.
2016-04-02 14:13:09	arup_r	ok let me look at this
2016-04-02 14:13:43	workmad3	arup_r: that post is describing what scenic does ;)
2016-04-02 14:13:55	arup_r	yeah.. :)
2016-04-02 14:14:32	arup_r	workmad3: scenic gem is the nice way to go.. :) thanks

2016-04-02 17:30:12	_lazarevsky	a quick question
2016-04-02 17:30:36	_lazarevsky	I created this migration -> 20160104100545_add_start_date_to_capacity_projects.rb
2016-04-02 17:30:46	_lazarevsky	but I must have forgotten to add any content to it.. when I open the file, it's empty
2016-04-02 17:31:01	_lazarevsky	class AddStartDateToCapacityProjects < ActiveRecord::Migration   def change   end end
2016-04-02 17:31:16	_lazarevsky	so my team mate wrote a migration which actually adds the column to the table

An error has occurred, this and all later migrations canceled:  SQLite3::SQLException: duplicate column name: start_date: ALTER TABLE "capacity_projects" ADD "start_date" date

2016-04-02 17:32:30	_lazarevsky	could it be that rails was smart enough to infer from the migration name that it should add a new attribute called start_date of type date to the capacity projects table?

2016-04-02 17:42:14	_lazarevsky	sevenseacat: so this is the spiel. I have a migration called AddStartDateToCapacityProjects which is empty, and then further down another migration called FixedStartDateToCapacityProjects which actually adds the start_date field to capacity_projects
2016-04-02 17:42:19	_lazarevsky	the later is failing

2016-04-02 17:45:17	sevenseacat	if it does, you have a serious serious failing somewhere
2016-04-02 17:45:26	_lazarevsky	and it bombed out at the FixedStartDate migration :/
2016-04-02 17:45:52	chridal	_lazarevsky: Because if you do, you could just rollback to that commit where you haven't deleted the migration, do a rollback and then migrate
2016-04-02 17:45:58	Abhijit	is this correct? config.secret_key = ENV["DEVISE_SECRET_KEY"]
2016-04-02 17:46:02	Abhijit	or i need to put <%

2016-04-02 17:46:26	Abhijit	will put it.
2016-04-02 17:46:26	chridal	ERB for instance uses that to interpret Ruby inside templates
2016-04-02 17:46:35	chridal	you don't need it inside *.rb files

2016-04-02 17:49:00	Abhijit	chridal, whats the correct way to use env var in devise.rb?
2016-04-02 17:49:05	_lazarevsky	you're right - this problem may not be present in prod
2016-04-02 17:49:17	sevenseacat	Abhijit: exactly like that.
2016-04-02 17:49:39	chridal	Abhijit: I don't know how Devise works to be honest. But ENV vars are the environment variables in a UNIX environment. These are variables that are available to the UNIX process once it is started.
2016-04-02 17:50:13	chridal	So that means that the ENV variable DEVISE_SECRET_KEY must be set in the environment that actually runs the rails server for it to work
2016-04-02 17:50:21	n_e_o	can i ask again?
2016-04-02 17:50:22	sevenseacat	have you verified that ENV['DEVISE_SECRET_KEY'] is set?
2016-04-02 17:50:23	Abhijit	sevenseacat, then i have that env var set in my ubuntu and still it asks me to set it manually by actually putting the key in config.secret_key=''? why?

2016-04-02 17:55:23	Abhijit	i now manually put env vars inside post-receive and that seems to work.
2016-04-02 17:55:42	chridal	So that might indicate that the ENV vars are not being loaded properly?
2016-04-02 17:55:56	chridal	Or even set properly.
2016-04-02 17:56:07	chridal	So you'll have to make sure that the ENV vars have the data that you expect to be in them
2016-04-02 17:56:15	Abhijit	yeah.
2016-04-02 17:56:39	chridal	Try using something like pry to check that the vars have the expected value

2016-04-02 17:56:58	Abhijit	whats that?
2016-04-02 17:57:09	chridal	So for instance; throw `binding.pry` just before using ENV[''], and then inside there write `ENV` and you an see all the env vars
2016-04-02 17:57:23	chridal	Abhijit: http://pryrepl.org/
2016-04-02 17:57:36	chridal	you'll want to learn that tool. I suggest spending some time with it, it'll make your life a lot easier.

2016-04-03 13:23:44	tbuehlmann	hey FooBarWidget, used it for a project some years ago. finding the right apache directives for the ruby version being used and other things wasn't hard, just a bit intimidating because of the long one-page-has-it-all-documentation. it worked for me, but I didn't feel too well with it since I didn't know anything about its implementation and integration with apache. by the time I somehow
2016-04-03 13:23:44	tbuehlmann	switched to thin, then later to puma because they were more, let's say, tangible to me
2016-04-03 13:25:41	tbuehlmann	I also had the feeling that it's a one-person-project (maintained by you) and that it's therefore risky to use it. but that's the case with other web application server, too. so I don't give too much about that argument these days
2016-04-03 13:27:00	FooBarWidget	thanks for the feedback. on the documentation side we've improved that a lot. take a look at www.phusionpassenger.com/library :)
2016-04-03 13:27:43	tbuehlmann	yeah, I read about it in here some weeks ago I guess
2016-04-03 13:27:45	FooBarWidget	we realized that the one-long-page documentation had reached its limits so we switched to something friendlier. there are now even end-to-end tutorials that cover everything from installing ruby, spinning up digital ocean and deploying rails itself
2016-04-03 13:28:06	FooBarWidget	ironically I'm getting complaints from people who are used to the one-long-page style
2016-04-03 13:28:38	FooBarWidget	they are used to Ctrl-F to search what they need so they now complain that it's *not* one-long-page. I'm trying to reach out to one of those people (I don't know who they are) to see how I can improve the library
2016-04-03 13:29:04	workmad3	FooBarWidget: heh :) that's how I used to find the bits of doc I needed when I used passenger
2016-04-03 13:29:18	tbuehlmann	yea, I can understand that
2016-04-03 13:29:43	tbuehlmann	having a good search in place is worth a lot
2016-04-03 13:29:47	FooBarWidget	workmad3: what do you think of it now? I've added various tweaks to accomodate the people who are used to the old style?
2016-04-03 13:30:27	workmad3	FooBarWidget: just taking a look
2016-04-03 13:30:28	FooBarWidget	tbuehlmann: as for internals, we have lots of internals documentation these days. the entire architecture is documented, how the integration with apache works is documentation
2016-04-03 13:31:09	workmad3	FooBarWidget: I think I'd be happy with the reference listing if I were to use passenger again :)
2016-04-03 13:31:09	FooBarWidget	about 5 years ago it was mostly a one-person-project. nowadays we have more people. we even have a new engineer hire in the pipeline, hopefully for next month
2016-04-03 13:32:31	FooBarWidget	but I'm kind of confused by that. puma and unicorn are *also* one-man projects, so how did they differ?
2016-04-03 13:33:16	tbuehlmann	as said, I don't give too much about that argument these days

2016-04-03 13:35:59	FooBarWidget	puma and unicorn have always been one-man projects
2016-04-03 13:36:28	FooBarWidget	passenger has always been a company-backed project, though until 4 years ago the development was effectively one-employee-backed
2016-04-03 13:38:06	tbuehlmann	right, that was a false impression by some-years-ago-me, but that went mistakenly into consideration
2016-04-03 13:38:13	tbuehlmann	just trying to be honest here

And each user has done a bunch of exams. What I need is to separately track the answers the user has given for each question.

2016-04-04 16:26:08	sevenseacat	there's no mention of rspec in section 6 because the tutorial is using minitest
2016-04-04 16:26:24	sevenseacat	so it generates a test/models/user_test.rb

2016-04-04 16:34:04	sevenseacat	the one i linked is the current version, using the current version of rails.
2016-04-04 16:34:12	sevenseacat	the version of rails in yours is no longer supported.
2016-04-04 16:34:25	scope2229	but its 4.0
2016-04-04 16:34:33	sevenseacat	yes, i know.
2016-04-04 16:34:33	scope2229	im still using 4.2.6
2016-04-04 16:34:41	sevenseacat	then you're doing things quite wrong
2016-04-04 16:34:48	scope2229	pmsl

2016-04-04 16:39:10	antgel	Hi all. Hope it's not OT to talk about CI / tests here. Our org grew and we're suffering. We use Jenkins to run minitests on every branch that a developer wants to submit to staging. The whole process including deploying to staging if successful, takes 20 minutes, which adds up when you have 5-6 developers in the queue (and even then their deploy may not succeed)
