2016-04-03 11:16:14	toretore	use a well defined, widely used format like json or yaml

2016-04-03 11:17:29	toretore	so you're not actually making the rules?
2016-04-03 11:18:55	toretore	the question is then: how can you parse a custom format defined by someone else for which no parser already exists?
2016-04-03 11:19:24	toretore	and this too depends on the format. it might be very easy to write a parser for or it may be very complicated

2016-04-03 11:21:37	ericlee	no idea why it does not work.
2016-04-03 11:22:24	toretore	ericlee: then why use realpath?
2016-04-03 11:22:39	toretore	if you know that the filename is correct?
2016-04-03 11:22:47	ericlee	toretore, because I need to know the soft link dest name.

I found your rdoc-rake and I'm trying to use it as reference (is so far the more coplex extension I found), but it's rather difficult for me to read and understand it, as I'm rather new to Ruby: I came to it because we're using Chef. do you know of aguide or doc I could read abut it?
