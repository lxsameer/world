2016-04-02 11:26:35	elvisthedj	Hi - I'm trying to bind a key to insert a latex template and it's not working for me.  What is the correct syntax of this in the init file? (global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-l") 'insert-file-contents ~/Documents/templates/letter.tex))
2016-04-02 11:27:22	elvisthedj	I couldn't find a global-set-key example that had a paramater after, so I'm not sure how to pass the filename
2016-04-02 11:31:19	wasamasa	that's because this kind of syntax is not supported
2016-04-02 11:31:29	wasamasa	you are required to put a command afterwards
2016-04-02 11:31:59	wasamasa	so, write one, then bind that command to the key combination
2016-04-02 11:33:13	elvisthedj	wasamasa: Thanks!  So I should be doing (defun insert-my-file ()... then binding to 'insert-my-file

2016-04-02 13:18:16	Jonsky	but C is very likely be to around for a very long time :(
2016-04-02 13:20:12	narendraj9	How can I write a function to save a command and repeat it later? For example, I want to repeat fill-paragrah but "C-x z" doesn't work because when I move to the next paragraph the last command is 'next-line', not 'fill-paragraph'. I would like to be able to save the last command and execute it later with a key binding.

2016-04-02 13:31:24	edgar-rft	The easiest solution in this case would be to use M-q, which is bound to fill-paragrah by default.

That's why it is important to find out what X keyname is used for the right Alt key on your specific Linux configuration. This X keyname then can be used in ~/.emacs (or any other ELisp code) to identify the right Alt key on your keyboard.

2016-04-02 15:06:04	APic	With PageUp and PageDown i can scroll the current Buffer by a Chunk of Lines
2016-04-02 15:06:15	APic	How can i scroll single Lines down/up?
2016-04-02 15:06:21	wasamasa	C-p, C-n
2016-04-02 15:06:49	APic	That only scrolls the Cursor, but keeps the Buffer
2016-04-02 15:07:01	wasamasa	that's because that's how one scrolled by lines in the 80ies
2016-04-02 15:07:02	APic	And when i scroll to Top/Bottom, it again scrolls by multiple Lines
2016-04-02 15:07:23	wasamasa	if you want to scroll like in the 00ies, (setq scroll-conservatively 10000)

2016-04-02 15:09:23	wasamasa	so, yes, C-p and C-n (and of course <up> and <down>) do already scroll by lines, it's just the redisplay that's weird about it by default
2016-04-02 15:09:24	narendraj9	Jonsky: Or next-line-add-newlines is nil. (next-line 2) works as expected but it seems as if nothing is executed in that case.

2016-04-02 20:00:07	wasamasa	also, it going berserk on C-d
2016-04-02 20:00:08	fommil	I've launched a process programmatically and need to do some action when a regex is hit, what's the best way to do that?
2016-04-02 20:00:19	wasamasa	time for a process filter!
2016-04-02 20:00:29	fommil	(launched meaning with `start-process')
2016-04-02 20:00:54	wasamasa	only problem with that is that the process output doesn't necessarily come in lines...
2016-04-02 20:01:03	wasamasa	so your message could be split apart

2016-04-02 20:01:56	fommil	wasamasa: cool, no that sounds good! How do I attach a filter when the process is launched?
2016-04-02 20:02:23	wasamasa	`set-process-filter'
2016-04-02 20:02:26	fommil	actually the thing I'm waiting for is typically the first line of output from the process. I'm starting a java process in debug mode and I want to know when the JVM is ready to accept connections
2016-04-02 20:02:36	fommil	wasamasa: and that's retrospective? The docs weren't clear on that
2016-04-02 20:02:39	Jonsky	wow, there's emacs porn? COOLLL
2016-04-02 20:02:44	didi	I guess I can `fgets' and then `sscanf' and _then_ `fgets'.
2016-04-02 20:02:55	wasamasa	fommil: you do it immediately after the line of code that launches the process

2016-04-02 20:03:19	wasamasa	fommil: now, I have no idea whether it's possible for the process to be quicker than that, but I'll just assume it's not :P
2016-04-02 20:04:03	wasamasa	fommil: fun fact: nadvice was written because someone complained that one cannot advise process filters

2016-04-02 20:04:51	fommil	ok, I'll give it a shot. Seems odd that there wouldn't be a way to attach a filter on launch
2016-04-02 20:05:48	wasamasa	also, this only works for asynchronous processes

2016-04-02 20:06:25	wasamasa	another issue is that these process filters are run when emacs is idle
2016-04-02 20:06:47	wasamasa	so, theoretically a constantly busy emacs will never fire one, but then, a constantly busy emacs will appear to be locked up...
2016-04-02 20:07:15	wasamasa	there's some fun workarounds for it, like `accept-process-output'
2016-04-02 20:08:13	wasamasa	read (info "(elisp) Filter Functions") on how one could deal with the problem of chunked data
2016-04-02 20:08:35	didi	rudybot: Should I keep trying to fix this or go play crawl?
2016-04-02 20:08:38	rudybot	didi: yeah crawl's what i always play these days

Though Emacs Lisp is younger than both Scheme and Common lisp, it is based on an older Lisp, but Emacs brings with it a great library for text manipulation and inter-process communication, which provides a great programming environment. ;;[Type ,more]

2016-04-04 14:24:07	Zackio	when i'm trying to debug it? fuck that
2016-04-04 14:24:09	twb	Like there is a feature where in sysvinit, dbus messages from the user go to ~/.xsession-errors
2016-04-04 14:24:22	twb	But in systemd, they go into the system log
2016-04-04 14:24:34	twb	So now my system log is full of all this shit about how vlc couldn't read some bytes off a DVD
2016-04-04 14:24:48	twb	Or how there are assertion errors in a GTK3+ window
2016-04-04 14:24:57	pjb	John[lisbeth]: (add-hook 'find-file-hook (defun john-find-file-meat () (when (string-match "\\.cl$" (buffer-file-name)) (whitespace-mode 1))))
2016-04-04 14:25:08	twb	And they all claim to be from the service that *received* the dbus call, not the actual process that emitted them
2016-04-04 14:25:33	twb	And this can't be turned off because the dbus maintainers assumed this was desirable, probably because it never occurred to them that some computers have more than one user
2016-04-04 14:25:43	Zackio	ouch
2016-04-04 14:25:52	Zackio	also, that reminds me, twb, why do so many gtk apps i use have so many assertion errors and warnings, are they just debug messages or not?
2016-04-04 14:26:02	Zackio	emacs doesn't have them, but a few others do, can't think of them at the top of my head
2016-04-04 14:26:08	twb	Zackio: because nobody ever fucken looks at .xsession-errors :/

2016-04-04 14:26:40	pjb	John[lisbeth]: oops, in emacs lisp, defun's value is undefined.  So you have to do it in two expressions: (progn  (defun john-find-file-meat …) (add-hook 'find-file-hook 'john-find-file-meat))
